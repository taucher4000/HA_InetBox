# Home Assistant Add-on: Truma InetBox Emulator

‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS STILL IN PROGRESS AND IS NOT YET READY FOR USE ‚ö†Ô∏è

This Home Assistant add-on emulates a **Truma InetBox** to control a **Truma Combi Heater** via a UART LIN adapter.  
It is based on the [inetbox.py](https://github.com/danielfett/inetbox.py) implementation by [@danielfett](https://github.com/danielfett), and integrates seamlessly into Home Assistant through MQTT Auto Discovery.  

With this add-on, you can control your Truma heating system directly from Home Assistant, without needing the original Truma InetBox hardware.

## ‚ú® Features

- Emulates a Truma InetBox over UART (LIN bus adapter required).  
- Full integration with **Home Assistant** via **MQTT Auto Discovery**.  
- Automatic device and entity publishing to your MQTT broker.  
- Local control ‚Äì no cloud or external services required.  
- Built as a **Home Assistant Add-on** for easy deployment.

## üîß Enabling UART on Raspberry Pi

To use the UART interface with your Raspberry Pi and the LIN adapter, you must first enable UART support:  

1. Install the **HassOS SSH port 22222 Configurator** add-on from [adamoutler/HassOSConfigurator](https://github.com/adamoutler/HassOSConfigurator).  
2. In your Home Assistant profile settings, enable **Advanced User mode** (otherwise the add-on will not be visible).  
3. Copy your `id_rsa.pub` key into the configurator settings.  
4. Run the configurator, then uninstall it after execution and reboot your system.  
5. Connect to your Raspberry Pi using SSH on port 22222, for example:  
   `ssh root@<your-home-assistant-ip> -p 22222`  
6. Mount the boot partition with:  
   `mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt`  
7. Edit the file `/mnt/config.txt` and add the line:  
   `enable_uart=1`  
8. Reboot the Raspberry Pi to apply the changes.
